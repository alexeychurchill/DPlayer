### Motivation

First of all, I'm highly interested in programming of audio and music things.
I have quite a lot of ideas which I want to try in the field. Of course, most of them aren't
innovative, but this more of an academic interest and a skill-up: I just want to figure out how it
works, how I can apply knowledge I've gained and how it can be used in practice.
So... **DPlayer** one of such things.

Another reason that as a DJ and music maker, I have my music collection as a bunch files,
which are placed across some directories. And, sometimes, I want to have this collection available
for playback from the phone. To be able just to take the phone and start listening and crawling
across the library.

### Typical use cases

_Short answer: your music library not in a streaming service and consists of files and folders._

**Precondition:** you have Android phone/tablet

* You're a DJ, you buy music on Beatport/Traxsource/Junodownload/Bandcamp etc. and you want to
  listen to it on your phone
* You're a vinyl/CD/cassette/MD/DAT etc. collector, you digitized your music collection and you want
  to listen to it on your phone
* You're a person, you have an "old school" files-folders music library and you want to listen it
  not only using Winamp, but also your phone too
* You're a music maker, you want to listen to your arts on your phone
* You're a DJ, you're making a lot of mixes and you want to listen 'em on your phone

### How to use?

Currently, the app is in active development. There's no release APK, AAB or Play Market link
available now. **But it will be in the future.**

Anyway, you can fetch the repository and build it on your own - `dev` branch is the development
branch, thus having the most recent code snapshot.

### Planned features

* Typical player features
* CUE files
* Android Auto
* Google Cast support
* Support of the DJ software libraries (support cues and loops positions) (_dream_)
* Advanced USB thumb drive support (_dream_)
* Dropbox/Google Drive support (_dream_)
* Multi-Window mode
